# Tic Tac Toe Implementation using Multi Agents
# Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game where opponents take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent does.
# Implementation
A variety of agents are desirable to employ, such as the Q-learning algorithm for reinforcement learning and the Alpha-Beta and Min-Max algorithms for adversarial search. By considering several parameters such the number of movements, node exploration, and the total time needed to complete the game, each agent aims to make the best choices possible.
# Objectives
Make agents for both adversarial search and reinforcement learning in order to play the game Tic Tac Toe.

Utilizing the Min-Max Algorithm, Q-learning, and Alpha-Beta Pruning methods, create three unique AI agents.

Play several games of Tic Tac Toe with these agents to test the performance of each algorithm.

In the game, players receive points for placing three consecutive symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

Determine pertinent measures to assess the three algorithms' respective performance. Determine which method—adversarial searching or reinforcement learning—is more successful.
